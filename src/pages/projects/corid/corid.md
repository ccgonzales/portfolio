CORID is responsible for the review and approval of all proposed activities that require the use of human cadaveric material in order to provide a mechanism for institutional oversight of proposed activities to evaluate whether they are within ethical and societal norms; follow a process which considers the scientific or clinical merit of each proposed study or training activity; and, ensure that informed consent was appropriately secured. The CORID Web application allows investigators to complete and submit the application form online.
