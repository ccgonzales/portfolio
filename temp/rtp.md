A simple site to match high school or undergraduates who have an interest in scientific research to participate in a university faculty mentorship program. This project is in progress and divided in to phases. The first completed phase is user registration and profile form. Phase 2 consists of a faculty profile. Future phases include listing available mentorships and automatically matching students and faculty based on set criteria.
